# Simple Chat

## Overview

A extremely bare web based chat service with multiple server implementations.

The purpose of this project is to setup very quick and simple messaging services where wireless infrastructure exists, but an external connection does not or costs money. For example, most cruise ships have wireless infrastructure, but using the internet is slow and expensive. SMS does not work either over the ocean. By using a laptop or phone as a server and distributing its local address, one can continue to keep in touch with friends / family.
